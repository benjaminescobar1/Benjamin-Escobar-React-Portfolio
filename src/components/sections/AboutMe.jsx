        Hello, my name is Benjamin Escobar, and I am located in the Bay Area. Some background information about myself is that I have a bachelor's degree in Business Finance from San Francisco State University. Although I have a business major, for the past five years, I've been working as an engineer. My current position is Laboratory Service Engineer 2 for a semiconductor company located in the Silicon Valley. I want to make a career change, which highly motivated me to sign up for this bootcamp. Prior to taking this bootcamp course, I have no background experience in coding, but I am motivated to learn and enjoy taking on new challenges to further my education and knowledge.
